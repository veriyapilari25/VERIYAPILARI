# Organizational Hierarchy Management System (OrgTree)
### https://github.com/veriyapilari25/VERIYAPILARI

This is a full-stack web application for managing an organization's employee structure.
The system allows administrators to add, update, delete, undo-delete,
and explore employee details such as departments, skills, and managerial relationships.
Admins are also able to add new departments.
It also includes various ways to visualize and query the employee hierarchy using core data structures
like trees, hash tables, and stacks.

## üîß Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, JavaScript, CSS
- **Database:** Entity Framework Core with SQL Server
- **Authinication** JWT Authentication
- `DepartmentController.cs` ‚Äî CRUD operations for departments.

- **The connection string should also be changed in the appsettings section.**
